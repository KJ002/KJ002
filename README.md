Hey! I'm James, a hobbyist programmer. I often write [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) although I am checking functional languages such as [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) however I am writing my own array based language [W](https://github.com/Wlanguage/core).
