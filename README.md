I often write [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) although I love learning about interesting and maybe obscure programming languages that offer something new such as functional languages in the LISP and ML families and I have also been working on my own concatinative programmming language [W](https://github.com/Wlanguage/core).
